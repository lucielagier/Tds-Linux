## Exercise 1: SSH 

1. Create an account on a cloud computing platform (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, IBM Cloud) — You must enter your credit card number, I have no affiliation — It is free. Delete the account in few month to prevent any fee 
```
```

2. Create a server instance on the website of your cloud platform (ec2 for AWS, Standard B1s for Azure) 
```
```
3. Connect to the distant server via your terminal — Do chmod 400 your private key file. The connection won’t work other wise — Use an SSH instruction to connect to your remote instance — Exit to return to your local machine 
```
```
4. Create a script named connect.sh to automatically connect to the remote instance 
```
```
5. Run the script to check it is working properly. Then exit to return to your local machine. 
```
```
6. Rename your private key to make it a hidden file. Propagate the changes to your script. Run the script.
```
```
